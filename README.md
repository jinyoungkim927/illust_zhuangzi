This project presents the complete works of Zhuangzi, enhanced with unique visualizations created by artificial intelligence. As you read through the chapters in the embedded PDF viewer, the adjacent panel displays artwork inspired by the selected text.

## Features

* **Interactive Reading:** Navigate the original Zhuangzi text seamlessly within the integrated PDF viewer.
* **AI Artwork:** Discover AI-generated images corresponding to specific passages, ranked by significance.
* **Dual Styles:** Toggle between **Naturalistic** and **Abstract** interpretations for each artwork using the **🦋** button.
* **Easy Navigation:**
  * Jump directly to chapters using the top navigation buttons.
  * Use the **←** and **→** arrows to browse artwork within the current chapter.
* **Deeper Insights:** Read the AI's description of the artwork and click to reveal its interpretation of the passage's significance.
* **Light/Dark Mode:** Switch between themes using the **☀️/🌙** toggle for comfortable reading day or night.

## How it Works

This website is generated by a Python script (`create_website.py`) that processes metadata linking text passages to pre-generated artwork files. It dynamically creates the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript needed to display the text and images interactively. The site is hosted statically using GitHub Pages.
