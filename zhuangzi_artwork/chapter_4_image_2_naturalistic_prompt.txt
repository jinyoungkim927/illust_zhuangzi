Naturalistic interpretation (Rank 2):
A delicate depiction of Yan Hui seated serenely inside a finely wrought bird cage, whose bars blur softly into the misty landscape around him. The cage rests gently atop an ancient stone pedestal amid a sparse grove of gnarled pines and rolling hills bathed in warm sepia and amber hues. Wisps of mist curl and drift through the cage’s bars, melding with soft ink-wash shadows that dissolve into the negative space. Yan Hui’s poised figure, rendered with light, flowing brushstrokes, holds a simple zither, symbolizing his tranquil spirit. The surrounding landscape elements—thin branches, distant mountains fading in soft gradients—evoke a quiet, meditative atmosphere, emphasizing the contrast between the tangible confinement and the expansive inner calm preserved within the cage’s fragile boundaries.. Style: Render in warm sepia tones with misty, dreamlike atmosphere. No text.
