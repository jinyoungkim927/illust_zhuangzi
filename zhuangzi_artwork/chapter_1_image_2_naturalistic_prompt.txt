Naturalistic interpretation (Rank 2):
A vast, mist-wreathed landscape unfolds with gentle mountain ridges and flowing rivers rendered in delicate ink-wash strokes, all suffused in warm sepia and amber hues like ancient parchment. At the horizon, the immense Peng bird is depicted with elegant lightness, its immense wings softly blending into the swirling whirlwind beneath, feathers sketched with subtle gradients that dissolve into the ambient mist. The sky above stretches endlessly, a gentle gradient from warm gold to deep amber suggesting the vastness of the southern darkness beyond. Negative space envelops the scene, emphasizing the boundless freedom and silent grandeur of the birdâ€™s ascent toward the mythical Lake of Heaven, inviting contemplative stillness and spiritual uplift.. Style: Render in warm sepia tones with misty, dreamlike atmosphere. No text.
